Police Data Challenge: Congratulations to our Winners!
December 6, 2017

In this fall’s Police Data Challenge competition, more than 70 incredible teams submitted their thoughtful analyses, using crime data sets from Baltimore, Seattle, and Cincinnati.

Just like the real statisticians working with today’s police departments, these teams leveraged joint problem-solving skills to analyze the data sets from real police departments in Baltimore, Cincinnati, and Seattle and propose solutions that will make these communities safer.

Congratulations To Our Winning Teams!
